It seems that parents tend to schedule these checkups on or _after_ the corresponding age (12, 15, or 18 months), rather than before. While we might think this is due to the understandable procrastination of young parents, many vaccines prescribe minimum ages (e.g., 12 months _or older_). As a result, doctors sometimes recommend (and insurance companies sometimes require) checkups with vaccinations coming on or after the child's birthday. And, of course, since these vaccinations are important to the child's health, the earlier the better. Hence the half bell curve."

    "Judging by the shape of the previous histogram, it looks like the first flu shot tends to be administered at a regular checkup, mainly 6, 9, or 12 months. Hardly any were administered before 6 months, which is [the CDC's recommended minimum age](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm) for a flu vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flu shot is administered far more frequently than the MMR, though. In fact, most infants are recommended to receive _two_ doses of the flu shot during their first flu season. The National Immunization Survey includes dates for (up to) the first nine flu immunizations, so let's look a little closer at some of these other vaccinations. This next histogram shows the ages at which children received any of their first three (reported) flu shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fascinating! The half bell curve is still pronounced for many of the regular checkups (6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months), but there is also a more rounded peak about a month after each one of those checkup dates, especially between 6 and 18 months old. The CDC recommends that for children receiving two flu shots in a single season (typical for the first season receiving a flu shot), there should be at least 28 days between doses, explaning the second peak. Since 6 months is the minimum age for the flu vaccine, and a child's first flu season in which they are eligible for the vaccine will come between 6 and 18 months old, this is the time period during which the double-peak is most pronounced.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is the second peak more rounded than the first? The first peak is a half bell curve likely because of minimum recommended (or required) ages for vaccines administered at those checkups. But the second peak of each pair is only for a flu shot. There is no birthday/milestone associated with the date, and parents might feel less urgency about having the _second_ dose at the first safe date than they do about vaccines their child is receiving for the first time. Regardless, we can see that the first flu shot dates exhibit both a seasonal effect _and_ some of the same checkup-oriented scheduling effects as the MMR, like the half bell curve. However, the _second_ flu shot tends to follow a more normal distribution of ages, despite tending to follow a regular checkup by about a month."

    "I don't know about you, but this isn't what I expected to see! I expected to see more of a linear relationship -- perhaps multiple lines with a `y = x` slope, but different intercepts (corresponding to the scheduled checkup closest to the start of the child's first flu season). Instead, we see a lot of blobs with a rough L shape, taller than they are wide. What does this mean?\n",

    "The vertical line component of each L corresponds to children getting their first MMR at the same age, but their first flu shot on different dates. More pronounced lines correspond to more children getting their MMR at the same age, and expectedly overlap with the spikes we saw in the histogram analysis above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal lines represent children getting their first flu shot at the same age, but not their MMR. Since the MMR is more tied to age and the flu to season, it makes sense that these lines would be shorter than the vertical lines. The fact that they point to the right, rather than straddle the vertical lines, corresponds to the half bell curve seen in the histograms. As noted above, parents bring children in for checkups _on or after_ certain ages, rather than before. And since infants' MMR shots tend to be done at one of these checkups, it makes sense that we would see this trend here as well.\n",
